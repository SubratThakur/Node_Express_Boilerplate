## Basic Node.js Project with Express, Babel, and ESLint
This repository provides a simple setup for a Node.js project using Express, Babel, and ESLint. Itâ€™s designed to help you get started quickly with backend development.

### Prerequisites
Node.js (Make sure itâ€™s installed on your system)

### Getting Started
